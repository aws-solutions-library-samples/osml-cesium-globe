### üìÇ Resources / Tips

- [Amazon CloudScape UI](https://cloudscape.design/)
- [Cesium](https://cesium.com/platform/cesiumjs/)
- [AWS SDK V3](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3) - This is a bit different, but I recommend installing individual packages.
  - If you want S3, do `npm i @aws-sdk/client-s3`, you can check if the service exist on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
